# Implementation notes

## Signals and phase behavior

`rst_n` and `pedestrian_btn` are active low. `HexH` and `HexL` use active-low segment patterns; the lamp outputs and `LEDR9` are active high.

The phase encoding is `00` red, `01` amber, `10` green, and `11` amber. The counter includes zero, so terminal counts 9, 2, and 14 yield 10, 3, and 15 ticks. `ControlSignal[5:4]` carries the phase and `[3:0]` carries the elapsed count.

The pedestrian request is sampled on the divided clock's rising edge. It stays latched through other phases and extends red while active. It clears at the **end** of red when the button is released, despite the original comment saying it clears when entering red. A held button has priority over clearing. A request arriving exactly on the normal red transition edge can be deferred to the next red phase because the phase transition uses the pre-edge terminal comparison.

## Reproduction limits and improvements

- **Input handling:** no button synchronizer or debounce circuit is included. Short presses between 1 Hz sampling edges can be missed. A practical improvement is to synchronize and debounce at 50 MHz, then latch events.
- **Clocking:** control logic uses a fabric-divided clock. A single 50 MHz clock with a one-cycle enable would simplify clock routing and timing constraints.
- **Reset:** the divider uses synchronous reset; control and count registers use asynchronous reset. Reset release synchronization should be considered in a board implementation.
- **Display decoding:** `BCD7Seg` has no default branch for values 10–15. Its normal upstream BCD converter produces decimal digits, but standalone invalid inputs retain the previous pattern.
- **Timing and pins:** no explicit board pin locations, I/O standards, or SDC constraints were supplied. Archived timing includes negative setup and pulse-width slack. A successful fitter result is not evidence of timing closure.
- **Validation scope:** the added regression checks arithmetic, valid decimal display outputs, normal phase cycles, a request during green, and extended red. Original stimulus tests are smoke tests. Full divider duration, physical button behavior, and timing closure require additional validation.

## Build evidence

[Fitter summary](reports/fit.summary) and [timing summary](reports/sta.summary) are copied from the original `Final_Working/ELEC2665S2Project/output_files` directory. They describe the historical May 20, 2026 build, not a fresh build of this reorganized repository. Device utilization is 67 logic elements, 33 registers, and 21 pins.

## Packaging changes

The 14 RTL modules and 14 original testbenches are preserved apart from line-ending normalization, trailing whitespace cleanup, and final newlines. Quartus paths now reference `rtl/` and `tb/legacy/`; testbenches were removed from the synthesis source list and a duplicate malformed comparator testbench entry was removed. Generated databases, programmer images, editor backups, and local workspace files are excluded. The external report, student-number filenames, and large video are not part of this repository.
